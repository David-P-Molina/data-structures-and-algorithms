Array
The JavaScript Array class is a global object that is used 
in the construction of arrays; which are high-level, list-like objects.

Description
Arrays are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to 
perform traversal and mutation operations. Neither the length
of a JavaScript array nor the types of its elements are fixed. 
Since an array's length can change at any time, and data can be 
stored at non-contiguous locations in the array, JavaScript
arrays are not guaranteed to be dense; this depends on how the
programmer chooses to use them. In general, these are convenient
characteristics; but if these features are not desirable for your 
particular use, you might consider using typed arrays.

Object
The Object class represents one of JavaScript's data types. It
is used to store various keyed collections and more complex 
entities. Objects can be created using the Object() constructor
 or the object initializer / literal syntax.

Description
Nearly all objects in JavaScript are instances of Object; a
typical object inherits properties (including methods) from 
Object.prototype, although these properties may be shadowed 
(a.k.a. overridden). However, an Object may be deliberately 
created for which this is not true (e.g. by Object.create(null)), 
or it may be altered so that this is no longer true (e.g. with 
Object.setPrototypeOf).
