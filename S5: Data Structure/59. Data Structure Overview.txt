Data Structures + Algorithms = Programs

WHat is a Data Structure?
Is a collection of values, Each data structure is good container for specific things
Data structures are useful for certain things
-a way for us to retrieve/put away data easily
Can store data types in data structures

Which data structure is best?
-it depends
DATA STRUCTURES
1. How to build one
2. How to Use it over another one

How Computers Store Data
CPU-Does the calculating
RAM-Random Excess memory, Much faster than storage
STORAGE-Persisted Save Data that will still be there when the computer turns off, it is slow

Ram allows us to run programs, each shelf holds 8 bits, 8 bits = 1 byte
1 byte is stored on a shelf without having to step downRam just needs to know which memory it needs to
The closer the info is to the cpu the faster it runs. 
CPU cache that stores info that is really really recent

What is a Data Structure?
-ways for us to store information
